            <p class="lead">The kings of F1 were given a task and they surely did deliver, When this car was first released back in 2013 it turned heads and made new fans me included.
              This is the smallest AMG in the range but its impact was big and it blew the hot hatch scene right open. When the new A45s was released it had the most powerful 4-cylinder engine
              in the world. 
            </p>

            <p class="lead">
              It was released with a 2L 4 cylinder turbo engine which produced 280kw and 475 N.m of torque and it was partnered with the 4Matic system and their 7-speed DCT gearbox.
              The latest A45s has the same engine but its power is bosted to 421hp and 500 Nm with a 0-100 in 3.9sec and a limited top speed of 250 km/h. The new car also introduced with it the 
              AMG Performance 4MATIC+ which in simple terms allows the A45s to drift which wasnt possible with the previous generation.       
            </p>

            <P class="lead">As an AMG fan i can say we were very happy with the new improvements but we were also suprised by the design of the car thats why most people that i know still prefer the looks of the
              old one and im <b>definatly</b> one of them.
