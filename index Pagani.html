            <p class="lead">First and formost like some car companies this is named after a person, and like other companies this was started because an employee wanted to try something
                that the company they worked for didn't want. This is a basic story of Pagani, He started his career in the automotive industry in the 1970s, working for Lamborghini in Argentina.
                Pagani was founded in 1991 and its goal was to  create a hypercar that would embody the perfect balance between art and science, combining cutting-edge technology with exquisite craftsmanship
                The Huayra was limited to just 100 units as part of Pagani's agreement with engine supplier Mercedes-AMG
            </p>

             <p class="lead">
               The first car created by the company was called the Zonda and it was an immidiate sensation in the automotive world, featuring a carbon-fiber chassis
               a mid-engine layout, and a naturally aspirated AMG V12 engine like the Huayra. In 2011, Pagani introduced the Huayra, the successor to the Zonda. 
               Named after the Incan god of wind, 
            </p>
            
            <p class="lead">
                The Huayra uses a 6.0L twin-turbocharged V12 engine developed by Mercedes-AMG specially for the Huayra, which has 730hp and 1000Nm. The engine has been designed at the request of 
                Pagani to reduce turbo lag and improve response, achieved with smaller turbochargers, a different intercooler configuration and re-programmed ECU settings. You wouldn't be mistaken to say
                this is one of the most powerful cars in the world. The Huayra has a top speed of about 383 km/h (238 mph) and it has a 0-97 km/h (60 mph) acceleration time of 2.8 seconds.
