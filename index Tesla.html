            <p class="lead">
              The Model S is the bigger sister of the model 3. it was first produced in 2012 and it's still being produced today. The model S is a battery powered car (its electric)
              with dual-motors and it is all wheel drive but there earlier models where rear wheel drive. There was a high performance version of it released called the plaid and the 
              which also had an optional track pack.
            </p>

            <p class="lead">
              The model S has a 0-60 mp/h of 3.1s With rollout subtracted (This is when they let the car move abit before starting the timer). It has a range of 402 miles (647km) and the
              maximum power output is 670hp, where as the plaid has a 359 miles (578km) range due to its higher performance. The performance comes in the form of 1020hp and a 0-60 of 1.99
              sec of a top speed of 203 mp/h or 328 km/h. The track pack on the Model S plaid adds upgraded brakes, better tuned suspension and track ready tires.
            </p>

            <p class="lead">
              The Model S also comes with Tesla's Autopilot which enables your car to steer, accelerate and brake automatically within its lane under your active supervision. The owner can
              also "call" the car using the summon function that retrieves your car. It also comes with a Autopark function that will park the car for you.
            </p>

              In my opinion this cars interior looks too boring and i don't think i would survive with it but i would buy it for its performance.
