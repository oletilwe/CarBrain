Welcome to car brain.
This is the birth of my two loves, cars and web development into one. This is a website that helps people with car knowledge about different cars in the world from
the Golf 5 GTI to the tesla and Toyota land cruiser and everything in between.
I used visual studio code to create the actual website along with using HTML for the structure and CSS for the "skin" as people would say. 

please enjoy my work as i did when i was creating it.
