            <p class="lead">
              This is the first fully electric car from Porsche and its called the Porsche Tycan and they in 3 variants the saloon sport, sport Turismo and the Cross Turismo. The Tycan
              has a maximum range of 678 km on one charge and it takes nearly 20min to charge. 
            </p>

            <p class="lead">
              Its probably sounds weird to hear me say this car has a gearbox conceduring its a fully electric car but this is the case, it has a 2 stage gearbox with upto 410 Nm.
              It comes with air suspension as standard but has rear wheel steering as an optional extra which would be most useful on a track day.
            </p>

            <p class="lead">
              There is the standard Tycan that does 0-100 in 4.8 sec which is impressive for a electric car that weighs more than 2 tons but it only gets better from here, and a bit more wierd.
              Next we have the Tycan 4s which the famous 0-100 in 3.7 sec which has a top speed of 250km/h. It is followed by the Tycan turbo, i did say it would get weird didn't i??, this 
              tycan does it in 2.7 sec and then the last one is the Tycan Turbo S which does the 0-100 in 2.4 sec and has a top speed of 260km/h.
            </p>

            <p class="lead">
              Firstly the top speed mentioned above are limited and i very much know it is <b>way</b> faster then those numbers, secondly the Tycan Turbo and Turbo S don't actually have
              a turbo this is Porsche's way of showing their higher performance verient from their standard lineup.
