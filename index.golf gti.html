              VW were in their bag with this car when they made this car. The Golf GTI has gained a reputation as one of the pioneers 
              of the hot hatch segment, influencing the development of other sporty compact cars. To my knowledge the only model from the gti range that wasn't as successful was the golf 4 gti. 
              For those that didn't know the GTI stands for "Grand Touring Injection," highlighting its fuel-injected engine. This is one car that has gained a very huge reputaion in the streets
              of South Africa and some of that reputaion isnt good. The <b>golf 6 GTI</b> has a 2L 4 cylinder with a DSG (direct shift gearbox). it does the 0-60 in around 6.8 and it makes 
              208 HP to the front wheels
            </p>

            <p class="lead">
              The golf 7 gti has 3 trims the standard gti the clubsport, and the clubsport S. The golf 7 2.0-liter TSI turbocharged inline-4
              Power: Around 210 to 230 horsepower and it has 258 lb of torque, like the golf 6 it also has a DSG gearbox. The <b>clubsport</b> has 2.0-liter turbocharged that produces
              round 261 horsepower and 350 Nm of torque. The <b>Clubsport S</b> has a Same 2.0-liter turbocharged but Power is Increased to 306 horsepower but has the same 350Nm, but this One
              has a manual gearbox to improve the driving experience. 
            </p>

            <p class="lead">
              The <b>Golf R </b>is a higher level above any golf R and one of the bigger improvements is All-wheel drive (4MOTION) instead of 2 wheel but it has the same engine as the gti but it 
              has more power. it has the 2.0-liter but has 310hp and 380Nm and in South Africa it only comes with a 7-speed DSG gearbox.
